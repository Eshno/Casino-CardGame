# Gameplay

Use your cards to claim cards from the middle.

You can claim cards from the middle if your card(s) matches the value from the one in the middle.
Say if there's a 4 and a 3 in the middle, their sum will result in 7, so if you have a 7 you can claim both.
If there's a 7 in the middle, you can claim it by using a 7.

If you're unable to claim any card, you must place a card from your hand into the middle.

# Combinations

*Build / Sum Combination*

You can combine a card from your hand with another one in the middle, this will result in the values 
of both cards sum. Say if you combine a 6 from the middle with a 2 from your hand, you'll need an 8 to claim it.

Build combination cannot exceed the highest card value (which would be 13).

The Kings, Queens and Jokers cannot be part of any Build Combination

*Call / Pair Combination*

You can combine cards from your hand into the middle that have the same value. Say if there's a 9 in the middle and you also
have a 9 in your hand, you can combine them, to claim them you'll need a card with the value of 9.

You can also use the Build combination to create a Call Combination within the same turn.
Say if there's a 7 and a 5 in the middle and you have a 2 in your hand, you can Build the 5 and the 2 so their value
would be 7. You can either leave them like that or immediately 'Call Combine' these two cards with the 7, so in order to claim it
you will need a 7.

When all players have run out of cards, the will be refilled with 4 cards again. 
The round will be over once the deck and each of the player's hand is empty.
The last player that claimed a card will automatically claim the rest of the cards in the middle.
