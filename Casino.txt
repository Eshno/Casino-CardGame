***Objective:
Obtain the highest score.

***Score:
Most Cards = 3 points
Most Spades = 1 point
Big Casino (10 diamonds) = 2 points #Done
Little Casino (2 spades) = 1 point #Done
Each Ace = 1 point #Done

***Playing:
You must take a card from the middle, its value must be equal to the value of one of your cards.
Example: If you have a 7. and there's a 7 in the middle, then you can take it.
Also If you have a 7, and there is a 4 and a 3, you can take both.
Else, if you can't play the hand, then you must place a card in the middle.

At the end of the game, when there are no more cards to deal, the player that took cards in last 
will take the remaining cards in the middle.

***Combinations:

*Build Combination:

The player must announce if he is building or calling/pairing.

This works this way: if there's for example an 6 in the middle, and you have a 2 and an 8, you can 
place the 2 in order to build an 8 from that combination of (6 & 2).

Basically, this consist that you can place a card over another to add both their values.


Any player can take the combinated cards if they got a card that has the same value as
the combinated cards.

You can combine as many cards as you want, but their value can't exceed 10. (At least that's how im gonna do it)

*Call/Pair Combination:

The player must announce if he is building or calling.

The player places a card of his deck that has the same value of one in the middle.
Ex: If there's an 8 in both your deck and the middle, you can place the 8 on top of the 8 in the middle.
The Called cards can be claimed by having a card of the same value. (In order to claim  called 8 & 8, you must have an 8).

This also can be played this way: if there's a 7 and a 5 in the middle, and you got an 8 in your deck, you can 
combinate both 5 and 2 to make a 7 and do a call combination on top of the 7.
